## ðŸš¦ Ground Rules

Please follow these rules strictly when contributing:

1. ** Do NOT commit directly to the `main` branch.**  
   - Create a new branch for your feature or fix.  
   - Example: `feature/login-auth` or `bugfix/navbar-layout`.

2. **Commit everything you push.**  
   - Donâ€™t leave uncommitted changes on your local machine.  
   - Commit with clear and descriptive messages.  

3. **Document your code.**  
   - I donâ€™t want headaches trying to figure out whatâ€™s going on.  
   - Keep your code readable and structured.

4. **Comment your code (especially complex logic).**  
   - If itâ€™s tricky, explain it.  
   - Future you (and teammates) will thank you.

5. **Donâ€™t copyâ€“paste random code.**  
   - If you copy snippets, at least understand them before pushing.  

6. **AI use is allowed, butâ€¦**  
   - Make sure you understand the code before committing it.  
   - Donâ€™t blindly trust generated code.
