# UnganaConnect – High Level Design

![alt text](image-1.png)

## 📌 Project Overview
Ungana-Afrika supports African civil society organisations (CSOs) by providing ICT training, tools, consulting, and research.  
Currently, most of their work is done manually (email, in-person workshops, unstructured file sharing).  

**UnganaConnect** will digitise these processes to enable:
- Broader reach
- Efficient resource management
- Stronger collaboration between Ungana-Afrika and CSOs

## 🎯 Client Requirements
- Centralised **training portal** for CSOs
- **Knowledge repository** for toolkits, case studies, guides
- **Consultancy request system** for structured project support
- **Event & workshop management** with online registration
- **Community forum** for peer knowledge sharing
